# HEALTHYCARE-DATASET-STROKE-ANALYS
Issue:  According to the World Health Organization (WHO), stroke is the second leading cause of death globally, accounting for approximately 11% of all deaths. Predicting whether a patient is at risk of stroke can help in early detection and making appropriate treatment decisions for each patient.
Data Provided:

The dataset "Healthcare-dataset-stroke-data.csv" contains detailed information about 5110 patients, used to predict whether a patient is at risk of stroke based on input parameters such as gender, age, various medical conditions, and smoking status. Each row in the dataset provides relevant information about a patient

In this task, we will use the Logistic Regression Algorithm to create a predictive model that can determine the likelihood of a patient experiencing a stroke based on various features available in the dataset. The goal is to develop a binary classification model that can classify patients into two categories: those who are at risk of a stroke and those who are not.


1. Explore the data and preprocess the data.

   In this step, we will first explore the dataset to understand its structure, examine missing values, and get insights into the distribution of the features. Then, we will perform data preprocessing to handle any missing 
   data, encode categorical variables, and select relevant features for model training.

2. The data preprocessing step is crucial as it ensures the data is in a suitable format for building the predictive model. This involves transforming and cleaning the data so that it can be used effectively in the machine 
learning algorithm.

3. By the end of this step, we will have a well-prepared dataset ready for training the Logistic Regression model to predict whether a patient is likely to experience a stroke or not.
